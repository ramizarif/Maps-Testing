couple of high-level ideas: 
- scenic route app
    - app that takes different routes and their street view to calculate the most scenic route to take
- unity integration with street view
    - will generate 3d models of the street view at certain locations
    - could possible idenity buildings as well
- algorithm to create the best route for multiple destinations
    - already a thing
    - alt idea: 
        - algorithm to calculate best places to stop on the way to destination
